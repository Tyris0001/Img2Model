# Img2Model

## What does this do?
Supply it with a direct-link to any image (png/jpg) and it'll work through the image pixel by pixel to create a 250x250 roblox model.

## Did you make this?
Yes, and anyone who claims I skidded this (Guba) why don't you learn how to code before acting so obnoxious?

## Does this still work?
This version doesn't, if you're lucky and you upload a bunch of images within an hour you'll probably get 2-3 through without them being deleted.
